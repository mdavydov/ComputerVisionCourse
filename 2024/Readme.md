Computer Vision and ANNs

Creating a course on computer vision that focuses on artificial neural networks (ANNs) while also introducing classic computer vision algorithms provides a comprehensive understanding of how both modern and traditional methods solve vision problems. This approach helps students appreciate the evolution of computer vision techniques and understand the foundational concepts that underpin current advancements. Here's a possible plan for such a course:

### Module 1: Introduction to Computer Vision and ANNs
- **Overview of Computer Vision**: History, applications, and challenges.
- **Introduction to ANNs**: Basics of neural networks, perceptrons, and the evolution of deep learning in computer vision.
- **From Classic to Modern**: How classic algorithms laid the groundwork for neural network architectures.

### Module 2: Image Processing Basics
- **Classic Methods**: Image filtering, edge detection (Sobel, Canny algorithms), and morphological operations.
- **ANN Equivalents**: Introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), understanding convolutional layers as automated feature extractors.
- **Hands-On Lab**: Implementing edge detection with both Canny algorithm and CNNs.

### Module 3: Feature Detection and Matching
- **Classic Methods**: SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features).
- **ANN Approaches**: Using pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction and matching.
- **Hands-On Lab**: Feature matching using SIFT and CNN features on various image datasets.

### Module 4: Object Detection and Recognition
- **Classic Methods**: Haar cascades for object detection, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) for object recognition.
- **ANN Approaches**: R-CNN (Region-based CNNs), YOLO (You Only Look Once), and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for object detection and recognition.
- **Hands-On Lab**: Implementing face detection using Haar cascades and comparing it with a CNN-based approach.

### Module 5: Semantic Segmentation and Scene Understanding
- **Classic Methods**: Graph cut, watershed segmentation.
- **ANN Approaches**: Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), U-Net for semantic segmentation.
- **Hands-On Lab**: Performing image segmentation using both classic and ANN-based methods.

### Module 6: Motion Analysis and Object Tracking
- **Classic Methods**: Optical flow estimation (Lucas-Kanade, Horn-Schunck methods), background subtraction.
- **ANN Approaches**: Using CNNs for predicting optical flow, RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and Siamese networks for object tracking.
- **Hands-On Lab**: Implementing a simple object tracker using both classical optical flow and deep learning methods.

### Module 7: 3D Vision
- **Classic Methods**: Stereo vision, structure from motion.
- **ANN Approaches**: Using CNNs for depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.
- **Hands-On Lab**: Comparing classic stereo matching techniques with deep learning-based depth estimation.

### Module 8: Advanced Topics and Emerging Trends
- **GANs in Computer Vision**: Generative Adversarial Networks for image generation, style transfer, and more.
- **Reinforcement Learning in Vision**: Applications of reinforcement learning in navigation and robotics.
- **Transfer Learning and Few-Shot Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models for new tasks with limited data.
- **Ethical Considerations and Bias**: Discussing the ethical implications of computer vision technologies, data bias, and privacy concerns.

### Module 9: Project and Capstone
- **Project Proposals**: Students propose projects that incorporate both classic computer vision techniques and modern ANN approaches.
- **Project Development**: Implementation phase, with regular check-ins and feedback sessions.
- **Final Presentation**: Students present their projects, highlighting the integration of classical and ANN-based methods, challenges faced, and results obtained.

Throughout the course, it's essential to blend theoretical concepts with practical, hands-on experience. Assignments and projects should encourage students to compare and contrast the performance, applicability, and limitations of classic computer vision algorithms and ANN-based approaches, fostering a deep understanding of both domains.
