# Module 4 homework

Task 1. (7 points) Finding ellipses

  1.1) (3 points) Implement 5-point and 6-point algorithm for finding ellipses;

  1.2) (4 points) Build plot with 2 functions:
   - (X) maximum deviation of points (0..20 pixels, step = 1),
   - (Y) maximum deviation of ellipse points from the correct ellipse for 5-point method (function 1) and 6-point method (function 2)
   - Make at least 100 attempts for every point of the plot and calculate mean value as a result
